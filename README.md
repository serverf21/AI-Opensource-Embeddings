In addition of openAI's API key and LLMs, there are several other open source AI models that we can use in order to train, and integrate with our production-grade applications.

In the projects in src/ directory, I have experimented with some of these models such as "Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2" to create embeddings and implement basic AI-functionalities such as feature extraction using the pre-trained models.

You can select the best open-source[free/paid] model for your project from -

For more information on how to integrate it with your project and perform functionalities like "Image2Text", "Text2Video", "DepthEstimation", etc. using freely available pre-trained LLM models, go to -
